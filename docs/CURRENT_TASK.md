# Current task

## Active scope — 2026-09-08

User requested a fresh Qwen3 six-layer implementation based on sparse-embedding's
code style, removing the superseded GPT-2/Llama pipeline. Local implementation
and CPU tests only; no replacement sampling, remote training, GPU termination,
or data/cache cleanup is authorized by this rewrite.

## Current implementation

- Model arms B0/A128/A256/A512/C/D now use Qwen3; stock B0 has 249,969,152 parameters.
- train.py uses HfArgumentParser, TrainingArguments, saved HF text datasets,
  multiprocess Dataset.map, cached tokenization/packing and ordinary Trainer.
- Existing sampled English Qwen data is the intended input; verify B200
  train/en and eval/en directories before launching.
- Superseded serial sampler, PackedTokens, train_capacity.py, GPT-2 manifests
  and its B200 preparation launcher are removed from active source.
- See CAPACITY_EXPERIMENTS.md for current architecture counts and commands.
- The historical research drafts are not the current execution specification.

## Remote state (last verified)

Serial sampler PID 106043 was stopped at 2026-09-08 08:42 UTC by runner commit
cb5b9d5. The first stop command failed before signaling because pidfd_open was
unavailable; the corrected command verified PID/start-time/argv, sent SIGTERM,
confirmed exit and stable output sizes. Evidence:
temp/remote_logs/swt_stop_sampler_20260908_a02.log.
Partial GPT-2 output remains on B200 (not deleted or reused):
/mnt/local/_data/deep-llms_th2/swt/english_gpt2_10b_seed0_20260907_a01.
All eight GPU burns remained active (155010 MiB, 100% utilization each).
No replacement preprocessing/training run has been launched.

## Infrastructure

Development: /disk/thuat/stagewise_widening_transformer, main,
nguyenhuuthuat09/stagewise_widening_transformer.
Execution: deep-llms/th2, main, checkout /disk/thuat/th2_runner_clean_probe.
Machine: thiennh-p6-oish-worker-0, 8 B200; @PROJECT@ = deep-llms_th2.
swt environments: /home/users/thien/miniconda3/envs/swt (dev),
/mnt/local/conda-py311/envs/swt (B200). Both clone each host's sparse_emb.
Dev torch 2.7.1+cu118, B200 torch 2.14.0; Transformers 5.9.0 on both.

## Next gate

Local verification passed: 42 unit/integration tests
(temp/qwen_rewrite_final_tests.log), all-six-arm BF16 CPU and two-rank Gloo
model smoke, and a real two-rank CausalTrainer D run with cached text preprocessing.
Distributed evaluation scored exactly 378 synthetic targets with NLL
4.5103965777; standalone evaluation scored the same targets with NLL
4.5103966587 (difference about 8.1e-8). Tiny tests are not production throughput
or B200 CUDA evidence. Reports: temp/qwen_bf16_cpu_smoke.json,
temp/qwen_ddp_cpu_smoke.json, temp/qwen_trainer_ddp_run/result.json,
temp/qwen_trainer_ddp_nll.json.

Before an authorized training run, verify the old sampled English data and
local Qwen tokenizer on B200, validate the actual Accelerate config and run
destination-GPU correctness/throughput smoke tests on authorized free GPUs.
